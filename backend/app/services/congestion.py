"""Corridor congestion resolution: static baseline blended with live feeds.

Why blend rather than replace:

  The seeded `congestion_factor` on each LineSegment encodes segment-specific
  characteristics - gradient, single vs double track, junction density. Live
  RailRadar data knows none of that; it reports how the NTES passenger network
  is running right now, corridor-wide.

  Each knows something the other does not, so neither should override the
  other. Live data adjusts the baseline; it does not replace the model.

Port congestion is applied only to routes that actually terminate at the port -
ships queueing at JNPT are irrelevant to a Nagpur-Pune move.

Provenance discipline is the same as everywhere else in this codebase: the
result says where every number came from, and missing live data falls back to
the static value rather than to zero.
